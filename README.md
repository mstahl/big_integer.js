# big\_integers.js

This is a library for handling arithmetic with arbitrarily large integers.
There are many such libraries like it, but this one is mine.

## Usage

BigInts can be initialized in a few ways: with a string, with a regular
integer, or with a list of integers.

    var a = new BigInt("7658963745894652748926748239657489563278594631")
    var b = new BigInt(1871)
    var c = new BigInt([190, 374, 11])

If you are initializing with a list, the least significant radix goes first,
and no item in the list should exceed `BigInt.base`.

    a.add(b)      #=> Add two numbers
    a.subtract(b) #=> Subtract b from a

## To do

  * Multiplication
  * Division
  * Modular arithmetic
  * Exponentiation/up-arrow
